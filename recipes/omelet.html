    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>An omelet, or omelette, is a deceptively simple yet versatile dish made from beaten eggs quickly cooked in a skillet until just firm, often folded around a filling such as cheese, vegetables, mushrooms, meats, or a combination of these. Originating from French cuisine, the omelet has become a worldwide breakfast staple, appreciated for its light and fluffy texture, and its ability to be tailored to individual tastes. The key to a perfect omelet lies in its preparation â€” the eggs are whisked to incorporate air, ensuring a fluffy result, and then cooked in a well-buttered or oiled pan over medium heat. As the eggs begin to set, they're gently lifted at the edges to allow uncooked egg to flow underneath. Once the base is set but the top is slightly runny, fillings are added, and the omelet is expertly folded, resulting in a semi-circle or roll shape. Quick to prepare, omelets are not only a breakfast favorite but also a go-to meal for any time of the day, offering endless possibilities for customization.</p>

        <li>Pour the beaten eggs into the skillet, tilting the pan to spread them evenly.</li>
