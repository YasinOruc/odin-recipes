Basic Recipe Website Project

Introduction
Welcome to the Basic Recipe Website Project! This project is part of The Odin Project curriculum, focusing on HTML and the fundamentals of web development. The aim is to build a straightforward yet functional website for sharing and viewing recipes, primarily using HTML. This project is an excellent opportunity to apply HTML skills in a practical context, understand the structure of web pages, and lay a foundation for future web development studies.

Project Overview
The recipe website will feature a collection of recipes, each displayed on its own page. The main goals of the project are to create a visually appealing layout using HTML and to structure content effectively. While the primary focus is on HTML, basic CSS may be introduced to enhance the appearance of the website.

Key Features:

Homepage: A welcoming page that lists all available recipes.
Recipe Pages: Individual pages for each recipe, detailing ingredients, instructions, and images.
Navigation Links: Allowing users to easily navigate between the homepage and recipe pages.
Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, I aim to demonstrate the following skills:

HTML Mastery: Proficient use of HTML to structure web pages.
Content Organization: Effectively organizing and presenting content in a user-friendly format.
Linking Pages: Creating links between pages to facilitate easy navigation.
Image Integration: Incorporating images to enhance the visual appeal and informativeness of the site.
