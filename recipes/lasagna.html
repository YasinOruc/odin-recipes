    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna, a beloved dish of Italian origin, is a culinary masterpiece that harmonizes layers of tender pasta with rich, savory fillings. Each layer is typically comprised of wide, flat noodles, alternated with generous portions of seasoned ground meat—often a mix of beef and pork—and sometimes interspersed with slices of vegetables like zucchini or spinach. The layers are luxuriously smothered in a robust tomato sauce, infused with herbs such as basil and oregano, which imparts a tangy yet sweet flavor. Integral to its richness is the creamy béchamel or ricotta cheese mixture, which melds seamlessly with the other components upon baking. The crown of this gastronomic jewel is a crusty, golden-brown top, formed by a final layer of grated mozzarella or Parmesan cheese that becomes bubbly and slightly crisp in the oven. This hearty, comforting dish is a staple at family gatherings and a classic choice in Italian restaurants, celebrated for its delightful blend of textures and depth of flavor.</p>
